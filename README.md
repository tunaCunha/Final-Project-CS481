# Smart Mirror: Final Project - CS481
Excuse the new repository. My professor was able to forward me the files from my teams final presentation, as I no longer have access to the school account which had the prior repository.

## About the Smart Mirror
My Smart Mirror project that I completed during the extent of my CS481 "Intro to Artificial Intelligence" course at Sacred Heart University during my Fall 22' semester.

I formed a team of like-minded senior undergraduate computer science majors to work towards a common goal. That of developing a virtual assistant, utilizing weak artificial intelligence, and an object detection machine learning algorithm. Over the course of a month, I led my team through a series of scrum sprints to develop a robust and efficient product.
